\arguments{
\item{file_}{is the file where the data is}

\item{sht}{is the sheet where the data is}

\item{v_old_begin}{is a vector containing the coordinates (row, column) where the data to be compared starts}

\item{v_old_end}{is the same but for its end}

\item{v_new_begin}{is the coordinates where the comparator data starts}

\item{v_new_end}{is the same but for its end
If the dimensions of the new datasets are bigger than the old one, only the matching cells will be compared, if the dimensions of the new one are lower than the old one, there will be an error.}

\item{df2}{is optional, if the comparator dataset is directly a dataframe}

\item{overwrite}{allow to overwrite differences is (set to T by default)}

\item{color_}{is the color the differences will be outputed}

\item{pattern}{is the pattern that will be added to the differences if overwritten is set to TRUE}

\item{output}{is the name of the outputed xlsx (can be set to NA if no output)}

\item{new_val}{if overwrite is TRUE, then the differences will be overwritten by the comparator data}

\item{pattern_only}{will cover differences by pattern if overwritten is set to TRUE}
}
\description{
Allow to see the difference between two datasets and output it into an xlsx file. If the dimensions of the new datasets are bigger than the old one, only the matching cells will be compared, if the dimensions of the new one are lower than the old one, there will be an error.
